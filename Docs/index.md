# Welcome to the FreeAgent API

The FreeAgent API provides secure programmatic access to the FreeAgent
service, allowing you to build cool and useful tools and services on
top.

The API distinguishes between access for companies that have FreeAgent
accounts, and accountants and bookkeepers who have a FreeAgent
[Practice Dashboard](https://www.freeagent.com/accountants/practice-dashboard)
that provides access to their clients.
